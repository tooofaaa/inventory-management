## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- A Supabase account

### 4. Environment Variables
1. Rename the existing `.env.example` file to `.env.local`
2. Open `.env.local` and update the Supabase credentials

### 5. Supabase Setup 🔑
To ensure the application functions correctly, you must set up the necessary tables and storage buckets in your Supabase project.

#### A. Database Schema
The complete database schema (tables, relations, and types) is available in the [`schema.sql`](./schema.sql) file.
**Quick Setup:**
1. Open your Supabase Dashboard.
2. Go to the **SQL Editor**.
3. Copy the content of [`schema.sql`](./schema.sql).
4. Paste and click **Run**.

#### B. Storage Buckets
1. Navigate to the **Storage** section in Supabase.
2. Create a **new public bucket** named `images`.
3. Set up **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies to allow authenticated users to Upload, Update, and Select files.

### 6. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### 7. Open in Browser
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
